=head1 NAME

Text::ResusciAnneparser - Parser for XML logfiles of the Resusci Anne Skills Station software

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

my $certificates = Text::ResusciAnneparser->new(infile => 'certificates.xml');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Resusci Anne Skills Station is a basic life support training station used by people
involved in first-line support in healthcare.
The training station keeps track of who trained when. This module enables parsing the
xml output file to be able to process the data.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<new(%parameters)>

This constructor returns a new Text::ResusciAnneparser object. Supported parameters are listed below

=over

=item infile

The input file containing the raw data log of the skill station software

=back

=head2 C<certified>

Returns a hash of people who received a valid training certificate. The hash contains keys with the
training dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD. The value attached to a date key in the hash is an array
of people.

A single person entry is a hash containing the givenname and the familiname of a person.

E.g.
           '2013-04-07' => [
                             {
                               'givenname' => 'Piet',
                               'familyname' => 'Konijn'
                             }
                            ],
           '2013-03-25' => [
                             {
                               'givenname' => 'Zjuul',
                               'familyname' => 'Cesar'
                             },
                             {
                               'givenname' => 'Pette',
                               'familyname' => 'Sjiekke'
                             }
                           ]

=head2 C<in_training>

Returns an array of people who started the exercise but who did not completed it and hence have not received
a certificate yet

=head2 BUILD

Helper function to run custome code after the object has been created by Moose.
